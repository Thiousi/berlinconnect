    <h1>The Story</h1>
    <p>A story which is as inspiring as it is controversial. A story of hope and passion; of death, betrayal and sacrifice.
    We are passionate about telling the story of Easter in the heart of our city, Berlin.</p>
    <p>This Easter will be celebrated with a Easter Special on Good Friday hosted by Alive, an Easter Sunday and a limited clothing collection by Alive.</p>
    <p>Easter is right at the centre of Christianity. It is the biggest date in the Christian Calendar. </p>

    <h1>The Cause</h1>
    <p>This Easter we want to be part of the solution for one of the largest humanitarian crises that the world has felt in decades, namely the refugee crisis coming out of Syria.</p>
    <p>You can get involved by donating individually to UNICEF or by purchasing limited collection items with proceeds going towards this cause. Our funds will help UNICEF to provide children with clean water, food, medical care, education and warm clothing.</p>
