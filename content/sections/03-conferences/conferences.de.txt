###Colour Conference

The Colour Sisterhood is a rising movement of women across the earth, who have a devotion, love and commitment to be the change in their local and global communities. Colour is all about placing value upon womanhood, so that we in turn can arise from a place of strength and cohesion and place value upon fellow humanity.
