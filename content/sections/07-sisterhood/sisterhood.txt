Title: Sisterhood
----
Intro: See women flourish and be empowered
----

Text: Our passion is to see women of all ages flourish and be empowered in every season of life. Sisterhood embraces that vision and is fleshed out on many fronts. Sisterhood believes in the power of community and a collective spirit.

During the week, we gather every Thursday morning from 10.30am to 12.30am at our Hub (Weinbergsweg 24) for a magnificent breakfast to embrace the vision of our church and involve ourselves in the movement across the earth.

To get to the next Sisterhood gathering, (mailto: conny@berlinclc.de text: contact Conny) for more information.
