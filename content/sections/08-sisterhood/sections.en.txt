Title: Sisterhood

----

Intro: Seeing women flourish and empowered.

----

Text: Placing value on women of all ages and empowering them to flourish in every season of life is what Sisterhood is passionate about. 
 
We believe that collectively we can make a difference locally and globally and endeavour to gather, equip and mobilize women to be a part of the solution.
 
We get together for a delicious brunch every Thursday from 10:30 to 12:30 at the ‘Hub’ Weinbergsweg 24 where we are inspired, encouraged, have fun, receive input, pray and outwork the vision of our church.

To get to the next Sisterhood gathering, contact Conny (email: conny@berlinclc.de text: conny@berlinclc.d) for more information.
