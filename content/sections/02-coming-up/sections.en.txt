Title: Coming Up

Intro: Next Sunday, Guest Speakers & more.
----

Text: Church is not what you think it is and is more what you think it is. Every Sunday, spiritual “food” and godly wisdom is provided that will strengthen your heart and soul for the week ahead. There will be a variety of speakers across the year, including our Pastors Mark & Joyce Wilkinson and some of the Berlin Connect team plus Guest Speakers from all over the world.
