Text: Church is not what you think it is and is more what you think it is. Every Sunday, we provide spiritual food for your week by our Pastors Mark & Joyce Wilkinson, by speakers from our Church, by Guest Speakers from all over the world and through informal panels.

We encourage you to be a self feeder by downloading past messages on (link: https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/berlin-connect-audio-podcast/id517067228?mt=2 text: iTunes), look onto our (link: /resources text: resources) or by grabbing our (link:# text: recent calendar) to plan your month. 

You can even (link:# text: sync this calendar) with your phone to stay connected or (link: http://form.jotformeu.com/form/22960694330354 text: sign up for our newsletter).
