Title: Coming Up

Intro: Next Sunday, Guest Speakers & more...

Text: Church is not what you think it is and is more what you think it is. Every Sunday, we provide spiritual food for your week by our Pastors Mark & Joyce Wilkinson, by speakers from our Church, by Guest Speakers from all over the world and through informal panels.

We encourage you to be a self feeder by downloading past messages on iTunes, look onto our resources or by grabbing our recent calendar to plan your month. 
You can even sync this calendar with your phone to stay connected or sign up for a newsletter.
