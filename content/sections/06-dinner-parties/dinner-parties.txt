Title: Dinner Parties with Purpose
----
Intro: Take your place at the table
----

Text: Dinner Parties with purpose are not just about food and eating together.It´s more than that. It´s about belonging, caring, sharing. It´s about authentic friendships and a sense of family, expressing kindness towards others locally and globally. Every fortnight on Wednesday nights we get together in homes, cafés and bars all across the city. 

Belonging in a community of faith will stretch and grow you in so many positive ways that isolation could never do. Take your place at the table and get connected into a Dinner Party.
