Title: Dinner Parties with Purpose
----
Intro: Take your place at the table
----

Text: Dinner Parties with purpose are not just about what’s on the table but more about who is around the table. Eating together in a relational way has almost become a lost quality of life and it has great benefits for our lives when we make it important. Sitting around a table is about belonging, caring, sharing. It´s about authentic friendships and a sense of family, expressing kindness towards others locally and globally. Every fortnight on Wednesday nights we get together in homes, cafés and bars all across the city.

Belonging in a community of faith will stretch and grow you in so many positive ways that isolation could never do. Take your place at the table and get connected into a Dinner Party
