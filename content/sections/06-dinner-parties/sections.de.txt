Title: Dinner Parties with Purpose
----
Intro: Take your place at the table.
----

Text: Dinner Parties with purpose are not just about what is on the table but more about who is around the table. Eating together in a relational way has almost become a lost quality of life, however it has great benefits for our lives when we make it important. Sitting around a table is about belonging, caring and sharing. It is about authentic friendships and a sense of family, expressing kindness towards others locally and globally. We get together fortnightly on Wednesdays in homes, caf√©s and bars all across the city. 
Belonging in a community of faith will stretch and grow you in so many positive ways, that isolation could never do. Take your place at the table and get connected into a Dinner Party.
