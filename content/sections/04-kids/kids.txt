Text: Our desire at Berlin Connect is to create a safe, fun filled environment that children love coming to and in doing so encounter Jesus as their Lord and Saviour. The Next Generation Team are passionate about expressing the message of Jesus in a creative, relevant way and seeing our kids walk in the truth of who they are in Christ.
