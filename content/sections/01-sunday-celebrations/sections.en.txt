Text: Sundays are Jesus focused and people empowering. Our desire is that Sundays will be a place where God´s sons and daughters can be encouraged and empowered to live from their New Identity found in Christ, as well as a place where lost sons and daughters can come as they are, see and experience the Father´s love. 

We have four services at **10.30am**, **12.30am**, **4pm** and **6pm** every Sunday. Our Sunday Experiences include live music, kids & youth activities for ages 1-18 yrs & translation for German and Spanish speakers. For more information contact Conny.
