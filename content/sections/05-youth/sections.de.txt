Title: Youth

Intro: Becoming resilient citizens for the future
----

Text: We especially place value on the youth between 14 and 18 in our City. By expressing Gods message in a relevant way we want to equip them to become resilient urban citizens for the future. Though diverse forums and get togethers, we aim to create an environment of trust and friendship that supports and inspires young people to be positive and hopeful about life and the dreams they have.  Friday nights and Sundays are a big deal.
