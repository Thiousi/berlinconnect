Title: Youth
----
Intro: Becoming resilient citizens for the future.
----

Text: We purposefully place value on the youth between 14 and 18 in our city. By expressing God's message in a relevant way, we want to equip them to become resilient urban citizens for the future. Through diverse forums and get-togethers, we aim to create an environment of trust and friendship that supports and inspires young people to be positive and hopeful about life and the dreams they have. Friday nights and Sundays are a big deal.
