Title: Dinner Parties with Purpose

----

Intro: Take your place at the table.

Text: 

Dinner Parties with purpose are not merely about *'what is on' the table* but more about *'who is around' the table*.  Eating together in a relational way has great benefits for our lives as it creates a sense of belonging, caring, sharing and family.  It’s a place where authentic friendships flourish and where we collectively express kindness locally and globally. 

This Wednesday we are meeting in Volkspark Friedrichshain for our legendary #Alltogether Dinner Party in the Park! Fun starts at 19:00 - see you at the longest Dinner Table of Berlin!
