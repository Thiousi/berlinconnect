Text: Key points
- 2015 is a brand new year where we can enlarge our life to dream bigger!
We think we already have a life full of responsibilities. But the truth is that we need to enlarge our life to go where God wants us to go.
- Sometimes enlargements means to let something else go in order to have more space. You need to clean up.

Key scriptures
- **Isaiah 54:1-3**
...enlarge the place of the tent. Enlarge your life! Enlarge your heart!
- **2 Kings 4:8**
… Woman built an actual room (enlarged her home) in her house for Elija, the prophet of god! Then a miracle happened in her house.
- **Proverbs 4:23 / Psalm 119:11**
	...out of the heart flow all the issues of life. Its important to guard our heart.

...Faith comes from hearing the message!
- **Matthew 14,13-21 NIV**
… Jesus teaches us principles on how to enlarge our life through the feeding of the 5000s.

… Jesus tests us to see if we can grow in our maturity and believe in the impossible.

**What we can learn from David’s Heart:**

4. Worship & the Word in his heart!

Action points:
