Text: Throughout the New Testament, Jesus is shown enjoying meals with people, many of whom were considered "sinners" and outcasts in society.

In Luke 19, we learn about Zacchaeus, a Chief tax collector, despised by his community for his greed. Jesus invites himself to his home for dinner and right after Zacchaeus changes his ways. 

In Mark 2:13 Levi, another tax collector was also very unpopular due to his profession. Levi invites "notable sinners" to the dinner together with Jesus. Later, we learn that Levi is who we call Matthew, becomes Jesus' disciple and authors the Book of Matthew in the Bible we read today.

And in Luke 7:13 he eats together with the religious people whilst a woman considered immoral comes in and falls at his feet. Right away he declares that her sins are forgiven, shocking those around him. 

In all three stories, Jesus doesn’t look at the past of these people. He accepts them as they are, even when they are rejected from society.

His grace, love and acceptance makes it possible for them to be radically transformed from the inside out. They all receive a  new identity. 

All we need to do is to take our seat at His table. At His table, Jesus does not show us the law of the Father, he shows us the love of the Father. He comes down to our level and lifts us.

Jesus is knocking at our door of our home which is a metaphor of our hearts and we just need to open up to Him (Revelations 3:20). Let us rest and meditate on His Word to learn more about who we are in Christ.
