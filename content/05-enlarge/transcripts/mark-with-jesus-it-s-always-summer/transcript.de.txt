Text: Stop living like it's winter and start living like it's summer. Jesus shines upon you! The SON is always shining! 

Hebrews 12 Ephesians 1:1-4 Colossians 1:18-23 
Why do people stop? 
**Distraction. **
No one is immune to it! We have more knowledge and resources than ever before at our fingertips. Jesus had every reason to be distracted! But he had his eyes on the joy that was before him, beyond the cross! We don't know if he knew everything beyond it but he trusted his father! 

**Discouragement.** 
To build the church we’re trying to build we need to be brave and courageous. Defeat Living in the past, thinking of your own mistake “Holy, blameless and without a single fault!”... that’s what God sees in you! Division Having a divided heart. Deception. 
So many people are pulled out of the light is because they were deceived. You need to walk in the truth DAILY, remind yourself! Why do people keep going? Focus. Focus on him. When we don't focus on Jesus, we might look at people and we might not like what we see. But with Jesus the way we look at people changes! 

**Courage **
We are here to make church history in this nation! 

**Victory** 
Live from victory, not live from defeat! LEARN from defeat. But LIVE from VICTORY Unity Stay together both outwardly & inwardly. But that doesn't mean you should be the same. Truth You have to walk in the truth daily. We have a future because Jesus is so amazing!! When Jesus was about to: get distracted → he chose to FOCUS on his mission get discouraged → he found COURAGE in his father get defeated → he was VICTORIOUS (the cross looked like a terrible defeat but it turned out to be the biggest Victory throughout history!
