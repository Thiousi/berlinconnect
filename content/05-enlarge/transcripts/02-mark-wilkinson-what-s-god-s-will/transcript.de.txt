Text: Key points
- The question “God, what’s your will for my life?” will lead to a lot of frustration. 
It is not the question we should ask. Leave the “my life” part out and just ask: 
**“God, what is your will?”**
**“God, what is your purpose?”**
**“God, what is your will?”**
And then we’ll line my life up with his will! 
On this road he will guide you, You will find your true purpose on that road!
- His purpose = Humanity reconciled! 
- We have all been given the job of doing our best to have humanity reconciled. 
- You will never find something in scripture that will tell you exactly what job you should have or what you should do with your life. But scripture says we are called to be like Christ.
God’s promise for your life is = HE DOES NOT DOUBT US! (=his faithfulness)

Key scriptures
**1 Peter 2:9 NLT**
We are all called out of darkness & to be light. We are called to be like Christ!
**Hebrews 11:6**
To be thankful in all circumstances, thats the will of God
**2 Corinthians 3:16-18**



Action points:
- Take on the attitude of a servant!
	Like Christ = 
he took on the attitude of a servant from the very entry point. Right from his birth. 
- When you find yourself serving – you will start to find your fit – and then you will start to find your flow in the plan & the purpose of God.
- God wants to see consistency & faithfulness & trust.
