We can apply what Paul mentions here in the 21st century

**what society do we live in?**
We have more freedom, more prosperity, more everything! We sometimes forget why do we have all these amazing things. We live in an individualistic society: we take what we like, but avoid what we have to give, shrink all down to our own interests.
It’s like saying I want what Jesus has to offer, but I don’t want Him. I want the moment, but not the rest of my life devoted. You don’t get something out of church, if you don’t put anything into it. 


**We have to make willingly small steps, based on truth that you do know
Understand: Jesus owes you nothing. If you have Him, you have everything. God just loves you, because He loves you**

**4 points**

**1. build deep spirited friends**
- let Christ be your example in everything, friendly is nice, but friendship is better
- comes out of a relationship with Jesus
- lets not bring a consumerism mentality into church 

**2. be energetic in your life of salvation**
- take it into your marketplace, work place
- doesn’t mean you have to talk about Jesus, let people see, it's not only in my heart, it's also on the outside, like a smile on my face

**3. be a breath of fresh air**
- people come with preconceived ideas, but they see a table full of generosity and hospitality
- when everyone gossips, choose to speak life
- if you have a Christian background and you call it home, be open for new ways to do things
- empathy, let people share, not talking about your things, value people, put love and grace on people
- we are not there to convert, we are there to love and lift people

**4. be living proof**
- out of His strength, don’t underestimate knowing jesus
- let your life show evidence of His goodness
