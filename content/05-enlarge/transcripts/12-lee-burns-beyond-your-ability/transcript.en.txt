Text: **Ephesians 2:10**
You are God’s workmanship

What you do does not determine who you are - who you are determines what you do. 

His presence enables us to do things beyond our ability.

Matthew 14
Jesus calls Peter to step out of the boat - beyond his ability.

Jesus says: “TAKE COURAGE”
If you take courage from Him, you will be able to do what you’re unable to do in your own strength.
Be assured that Jesus will give you what you need to accomplish what He wants you to do. 

Growth comes from uncertainty.

Jesus says: “STEP FORWARD.”

One step at a time. Christianity doesn’t happen on one day  - it’s a progress. You will probably make mistakes and fail, but that doesn’t make you a failure. Keep moving forward. Jesus will help you out every time, He is for you, His grace is for you, His love is for you. 

Jesus says: “STAY FOCUSED”

Peter began looking around and saw the waves, saw his circumstances, and it frightened him. Keep your eyes focused on Jesus and watch what He does. If you stay focused, you will grow and you will change - not instantly and all at once, but step by step.

When we can get out of the boat and out of our zone of comfort, we can experience the supernatural power of Jesus.
