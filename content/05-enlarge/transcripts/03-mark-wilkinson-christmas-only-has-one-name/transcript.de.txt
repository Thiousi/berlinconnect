Text: Key points
- Christmas only has one name: EMMANUEL 
= GOD WITH US
- Christmas represents the promise of God towards humanity
- God has promised you & I his constant presence in our lives.

Key scriptures
- Matthew 1:23
...and they shall call his name Immanuel which is translated “God with us”
- Hebrew 13:5 CEV
...The Lord has promised he will never leave us or never desert us.

Action points:
- 1. We have access to God’s presence 24hrs a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
**Ephesians 3:12 NLT**
...Because of this promise we can now come boldly and confidently into his presence, assured of his glad welcome!
- 2. God’s presence comes by staying connected to Jesus
**John 15:4 CEV**
Stay joined to me, and I will stay joined to you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it stays joined to the vine, you cannot produce fruit unless you stay joined to me.
Who’s responsibility is it, to stay connected to Jesus? It’s our responsibility.
**Hebrews 13:5 CEV**
...the Lord will never leave or forsake me.
Can we believe that he will never leave us?
Are you going to allow circumstances to steal the presence of God?
Let’s put more value on God’s presence for our life.
Go for his presence more than for anything else
- 3. God’s presence is always around an attitude of thanksgiving
How can you place value on others without placing value on yourself?
Learn to develop a character that helps us to be what God called us to be.
**Philippians 4:6 CEV**
...Don’t worry about anything, but pray about everything. With THANKFUL HEARTS offer up your prayers and reque
**Colossians 2:7 CEV**
...Plant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life. Be strong in your faith, just as you were taught. And be THANKFUL & GRATEFUL.
