Text: - Business, art, media, advertising etc are influencing our lives, suggesting that a product, philosophy, career can satisfy our deep longing for connection that can only be fulfilled through surrendering to Jesus (see Mark 5 - story of the woman with the issue of blood) 

- Loneliness and brokenness are human problems (not limited to marital status)
Suggestion of primary school kids to solve humanity’s problems (“The All Better Book”)
		*Caris, 8 years*:
“Get all the phone numbers of all the lonely people and all of those who are not lonely and when we should bring them together”
*Mark, 9 years*:
“We should design food that can talk to you. It would ask how you are and be your buddy as long as you eat”
*Matt, 8 years*:
“We would solve all the problems of the earth if we would get all the lonely people a pet or a husband.”

- Loneliness isn’t always the absence of people or affection but the absence of purpose and direction.

- Jesus died lonely, He understands our condition and is able to heal (“Live well, live blessed and be healed of your sickness.” Mark 5:35 MSG)

- Healing can be found in touching Him by taking a leap of faith

Only Jesus can bring wholeness and healing!

And suddenly with JESUS your mess will turn into a MESSAGE!

**Let's build a real church, a refuge for lonely & broken people.
Let's build a church that our city can relate to.**
