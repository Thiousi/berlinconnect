**KEY POINTS:**
1. To help the people who lack power we need to know our foundation: The bible has all the answers to human problems.
2. In every race, when God calls us into action, we are running as a runner with no name. 
3. Our job as sons and daughters of God is to be ready when God needs us to lead in society.

**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**James 2:14-20 (CEV) **
14 My friends, what good is it to say you have faith, when you don’t do anything to show that you really do have faith? Can that kind of faith save you? 15 If you know someone who doesn’t have any clothes or food, 16 you shouldn’t just say, “I hope all goes well for you. I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat.” What good is it to say this, unless you do something to help? 17 Faith that doesn’t lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead!
18 Suppose someone disagrees and says, “**It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds.”
I would answer, “Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds, and I will prove that I have faith by doing them**.” 19 You surely believe there is only one God. That’s fine. Even demons believe this, and it makes them shake with fear.
20 Does some stupid person want proof that **faith without deeds is useless**?
<br>
**Psalm 68:5-6 (NLT)**
5 Father to the fatherless, defender of widows— this is God, whose dwelling is holy.6 God places the lonely in families; he sets the prisoners free and gives them joy. But he makes the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
<br>
**2 Samuel 18:19-33 (NLT)**
19 Then Zadok’s son Ahimaaz said, “Let me run to the king with the good news that the Lord has rescued him from his enemies.” 20 “No,” Joab told him, “it wouldn’t be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today.” 21 Then **Joab said to a man from Ethiopia, “Go tell the king what you have seen.**” The man bowed and ran off. 22 But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, “Whatever happens, please let me go, too.” “Why should you go, my son?” Joab replied. “There will be no reward for your news.” 23 “Yes, but let me go anyway,” he begged. Joab finally said, “All right, go ahead.” So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.
24 While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them. 25 He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, “If he is alone, he has news.” As the messenger came closer, 26 the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, “Here comes another one!” The king replied, “He also will have news.” 27 “The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok,” the watchman said. “He is a good man and comes with good news,” the king replied.
28 Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, “Everything is all right!” He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Praise to the Lord your God, who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king.” 29 “What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?” Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab told me to come, there was a lot of commotion. But I didn’t know what was happening.” 30 “Wait here,” the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.
31 Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said, “I have good news for my lord the king. Today the Lord has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you.” 32 “What about young Absalom?” the king demanded. “Is he all right?” And the Ethiopian replied, “May all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!” 33 The king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, “O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son.”

**Who are the poor?**
The bible defines people who are poor as “people who lack power”. In our world that are the elderly, solo families, orphans, refugees, new immigrants, widows, unemployed, people with disability, natural disaster victims and so on.
**To help the people who lack power we need to know our foundation - We are running as a runner with no name!**
We are supposed to run, we are supposed to do what God has called us to do. But we shall do it only for His name, Jesus name! Not for our own glory, but for His glory. For no other name than His name! Just like the guy from Ethiopia in the story of Samuel who ran to serve the king, rather than promoting himself. 
**Our job as sons and daughters of God is to be ready when God needs us to lead in society**
In the beginning of creation, humanity was entrusted with the care of all creation not just the spiritual but also physical. We can not lead without being a follower, because leaders produce followers. Everything about leadership is about taking responsibility. Leaders shine when times are tough. The bible has all the answers we need to lead in tough times that humanity is facing. The church is a walking resource centre, we have everything we need to meet the current situation. The essence of leadership is that where’s leadership, there’s innovation. Hence, the church is filled with opportunites and possibilites of innovation.

**CONCLUSION:**
Because God is real we get involved. If we are going to help people who lack power, we need to know: What is the priority of the local church? To help the people who lack power we need to know: What’s our true motivation for helping? As sons and daughters of God, we are called to be ready when God needs us to lead in society. The bible has all the answers we need to lead in tough times. But to help the people who lack power, we need to know our foundation - We are running as a runner with no name! We are gonna do the best we can with what we have. Without our own agenda, with the best intention - for His glory!
