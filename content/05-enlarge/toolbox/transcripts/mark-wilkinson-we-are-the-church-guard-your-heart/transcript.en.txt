Text: Key scriptures
- **Proverbs 4:23 NKJ **
Be careful what you think because your thoughts run your life.
Guard your heart.

Its amazing what you can do with your thoughts. You can fight with yourself or agree with yourself. A lot of people ruin their life because they got hijacked with their thoughts.
 
*How much time do we dedicate to change how we think?*
 
If we want to move forward next year, we need to solve our thought-life out.
And our thoughts are always connected to our heart.
 
How can we guard your heart?
By hanging around an environment of wisdom!

The house of God is not only about teaching but about an environment of love, vision and wisdom! 
If you commit to an environment, you learn by example and in relationships.
Sadly, we don’t value as much that Church is an environment.
But its this environment, through which you can get wisdom.
 
Lets understand how beautiful it is to be part of a Church environment, where you can find vision, values and wisdom.
 
Its a place where we can learn more about how to guard our heart. 
Where we learn that there is a redemptive story for our life.
Where we learn that our future will be bright because of Jesus.
Where we learn that we are purposeful people.
 
If God came to you and would ask “What do you want?”
How quick would you answer?
Would you know what you would want?
Would it be hard to answer?
This question sums everything up.
….”more money” or “getting through university” … are all quick answers! temporary answers!
All of these things are not wrong but they reveal where your heart is! Where you’re at
But its deeper than this! Dont build yourself into a prison.
Think good before you answer this question.
 
Salomon got asked this question by God and he answered “I want a wise heart so that I can lead your people”. Salomons answer was about people not about him.
 
The way we answer shows where our heart is at.
If we don’t know how to answer it, we should bring ourselves in a place where we find out what our answer will be.
Be part of a Church that is not only about teaching, but about an environment of love.
Where you are part of a community full of vision and wisdom.
