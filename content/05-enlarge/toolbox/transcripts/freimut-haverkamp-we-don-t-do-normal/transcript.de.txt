Text: **Key points:**
- **God is not normal**
	He made everything out of nothing. He can speak things into being.
He can have a lot of attributes but definitely not normal.
- **Jesus was not normal**
Jesus healed people and made miracles possible - he was not a normal person.
- **The disciples of Jesus were not normal!**
	Following Jesus was not an average life. It was exciting and miraculous.
That means that OUR LIFE is not supposed to be normal!
	Why do we then pray for a normal life / job / week / relationship?
	We serve a God that is supernatural! The moment you invited Jesus into your Life, 
you said Goodbye to normal. Once you did that you don’t expect to live a normal life. 
Because God is with you and he is going to use you in a supernatural way.
People think they are safe in their little boat but when a wave or a storm comes - we are not safe. We need God - so we better believe in him and stop being normal.
Don't settle for anything less that what God has for you on your life.

Three points why we dont do normal:

**1. Because we know we are not normal we don't expect the normal.**

- What do you expect in life? Do you expect a bad or a good day?Do you have the hope that God has a great future for you?
Philippians 1:20 NIV:
Peter is in prison and still believes that God will make a way
- No matter where you came from, you can still have the expectation that God will take you further
When you expect the good things, you will receive good things
- Oxford University did a study on expectation in the classroom:
They observed 40 kids and a teacher for a year
before they identified the intelligent kids and the average kids
they explained the results to the teacher but changed up the names of the kids
After a year, the scientists could see that the kids framed as more intelligents were better in all the subjects, in their social skills etc.
the teacher expected them to do well and therefore they did well.
Lets not underestimate what happens when we expect the right things!

**2. Because we are not normal our faith exceeds the normal**
- We don't just have faith to come through, we have faith.
- We believe in things no one else believes in because our faith isn't normal
- Mark 9, 23 NIV:
“What do you mean, ‘If I can’?” Jesus asked. “Anything is possible if a person believes.”. 
We can have faith because God gave us grace. The word became flesh and came into the neighborhood. Grace spoke to us trough Jesus, who came to earth to say to us: This is possible.

**3. Because we are not normal, our actions are not normal.**
- Because we have faith, we can act as if it has already happened. We can enter His presence with boldness.
- Because of our hope in Him, we can be bold and we can life our life bold. It makes a difference!

**Key scriptures**
- 2 Corinthians 5:17 NLT
- Philippians 1:20 NIV
- Mark 9, 23 NIV

**Action points:**
- Lets not settle with “normal”.
- Take on what God has for you and believe him to do great things with you!
- You can live a bold life, because His grace and His presence.
