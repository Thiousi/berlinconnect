**Richard** - Richard had his first church experience growing up in a conservative church in Brazil. 
**Mo** - Before Mo came to Berlin Connect, she was part of a pentecostal African church in Kenya. 
**Vera** - Vera was an atheist before going backpacking in Australia, walking into a church and having a spiritual experience there. 
**Dave** - Dave grew up in the former GDR where Jesus or the church were never a part of his experience. He later made his peace with God while attending a protestant church. 
Mark - Mark got to know Jesus at age 23.

**1. Why do we need to lose our religion when we’ve met Jesus? **
Building relationships with people is what Jesus is all about. In religion, there is no forgiveness, it sets the standard that needs to be fulfilled. Therefore, religion doesn’t promote relationships. Jesus gets very angry about that - He is not about religion, He is all about loving, accepting and giving peace to people. 
<br>
**2. Where does religion come from and why is it so powerful? **
Religion is mankind trying to make sense of God. On the other hand, what Jesus represents is mind-blowing and beats logic - almost too easy to live by. 
<br>
**3. How come people always associate Jesus with religion?**
It depends on how Jesus is presented to people. Religion is a “faith system”, whereas Jesus is a person. If you only get to know the system and don’t have a personal revelation and relationship with Jesus, you come to associate Him with religion. 
<br>
**4. How does tradition play into it?**
Communities developed rituals that might have meaning to older generations, but don’t anyore for younger people. 
Heart check: why are we doing thing the way we do. 

**3 people that have predominantly shaped thinking about religion and faith: **
**Sigmund Freud** - Freud saw religion as a psychological self-justification.
**Karl Marx** - sociological justification. 
**Friedrich Nietzsche** - Nietzsche saw religion as nothing more than a power trip. 

Jesus was equally - if not more - anti-religious as those three. 
<br>
**5. Why did it take so long for Jesus to come and clarify the difference between relationship and religion? **
Even in the Old Testament, some people had a lively relationship with God. It was possible even before Jesus. God has the right timing for everything and certain things had to happen before the right moment in history arrived for the Saviour to come. All the innovations during the Roman Empire made it possible for the message of Jesus to spread like a wildfire.

You’ve never seen rage until you’ve seen religion. Jesus and religion are not in the same box. 
God isn’t forcing religion on us. Instead, He longs to have a relationship with us. Out of love, He is allowing everyone to be free in their choice. 
<br>
**6. Friends who aren’t Christian - what would you say to them? **
Every religion has a picture of Jesus and there is a lot that the different faiths have in common. The ultimate divide comes with the view if Jesus was God or wasn’t. I try to point people to Jesus and let them come to their own conclusion. It’s not about winning an argument, it’s about looking at who Jesus really was. 

The Gospel is like a lion: if you let it out it defends itself. We just need to look for opportunities to share Jesus and be wise about how we do it. 
<br>
**7. Conclusion** 
If you have a relationship, you see the person, not the label. Religion restricts and sees the rules and the regulation. But Jesus sees the person. Healing people on the Sabbath was illegal - Jesus did it anyways. Jesus messed everything up when it came to religion. 

Religion is about striving. You are never good enough with religion. Only with Jesus will you truly get peace. It’s not about our holiness, it’s about His holiness. Religion puts you under pressure, the relationship puts Jesus under pressure. God is still bigger than religion because love is unstoppable. 

Be there. Love people. Be their biggest encourager. Live your faith.
