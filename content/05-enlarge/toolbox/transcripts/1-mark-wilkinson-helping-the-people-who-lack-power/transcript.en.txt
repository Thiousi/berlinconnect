**KEY SCRIPTURES + CONCEPTS: **
**James 2:14-20 (CEV) **
14 My friends, what good is it to say you have faith, when you don’t do anything to show that you really do have faith? Can that kind of faith save you? 15 If you know someone who doesn’t have any clothes or food, 16 you shouldn’t just say, “I hope all goes well for you. I hope you will be warm and have plenty to eat.” What good is it to say this, unless you do something to help? 17 Faith that doesn’t lead us to do good deeds is all alone and dead!
18 Suppose someone disagrees and says, “**It is possible to have faith without doing kind deeds.”
I would answer, “Prove that you have faith without doing kind deeds, and I will prove that I have faith by doing them.**” 19 You surely believe there is only one God. That’s fine. Even demons believe this, and it makes them shake with fear.
20 Does some stupid person want proof that faith without deeds is useless?
<br>
**Psalm 68:5-6 (NLT)**
5 Father to the fatherless, defender of widows— this is God, whose dwelling is holy.6 God places the lonely in families; he sets the prisoners free and gives them joy. But he makes the rebellious live in a sun-scorched land.
<br>
**The story of migration is a human story**
The story of migration is a human story. But at the same time, it is important to understand that the human story is a story of migration. People always migrated. Even in the times of the bible people migrated because of war, because of unhealthy circumstances. Even though there is lots of danger, mess and hurt in migration, it also brings with it new opportunites - not only for the people migrating but also for us!
<br>
**Matthew 9:35-38 (MSG)**
35-38 Then Jesus made a circuit of all the towns and villages. He taught in their meeting places, reported kingdom news, and healed their diseased bodies, healed their bruised and hurt lives. When he looked out over the crowds, his heart broke. So confused and aimless they were, like sheep with no shepherd. “What a huge harvest!” he said to his disciples. “How few workers! On your knees and pray for harvest hands!”
<br>

**2 Kinds of poverty and the strategy: **
Church should not be isolated from society. God has given us a framework how to move forward in times of crises. 
1. Physical poverty = Relief, Partnership and Reform 
2. Spiritual poverty = Proclaim, Preach and Teach 

**To help the people who lack power we need to know our foundation**
In the beginning of creation, humanity was entrusted with the care of all creation not just the spiritual but also physical.
<br>
**To help the people who lack power we need to know: What is the priority of the local church? **
It means first that the Gospel must be proclaimed. The bible has all the answers to human problems.
1. WE TALK - We proclaim – preaching and teaching.
2. WE WALK - We do – love and serve people.
<br>
**God’s way is to be spiritually alive and physically involved 
The Gospel is the reason behind all Christian practice individually, corporately.**
The Gospel is not only proclaiming it to people so that they will embrace and believe it; it is also teaching and shepherding believers so they can ‘live it out’ in society.
 <br>
4 Things that happen because of sin:
1. Spiritually alienated from God.
2. Social alienation from each other – we start to cover up.
3. Physical alienation – we die, we get sick.
4. Physiological alienation – we blame.
<br>
God’s redemption purpose is to deal with all these 4 areas: 
- Creation and fall, 
- Redemption and
- Restoration.
<br>
**The Gospel affects our relationship to the people who lack power:**
- Because I am loved – I can love others.
- Because I am accepted – I can accept others.
- Because I am forgiven – I can forgive others.
- Because I am approved by Christ – I don’t need to seek the approval of others.
- Because I am loved by Christ – I don’t need to seek love from others to make me complete.
- Because I am complete in Christ – I don’t need to seek it from others or in other things.
 <br>
**To help the people who lack power we need to know: What’s our true motivation for helping?**
Why do you serve? Help the people who lack power? Why do you live for Christ? Why do you do what you do?
 <br>
**The Gospel fuels our motivation for helping and serving others**
If you don’t live your life today from the Gospel, you will live your life today from your past.
It transforms me on a daily basis giving me the right motivation to live life helping others.
 <br>
**The difference between charity and justice?**
The Good Samaritan: We see medical care, financial involvement, personal involvement.
Show mercy - bring justice into the situation.
We see someone from a different background involved in the life of someone considered different (cultural and/or racial barriers removed).
 <br>
**To help the people who lack power we need to know: What’s our strategy? **
 
1. **RELIEF** is direct help – it’s when we work together to help someone out. 
2. **PARTNERSHIP** –  a plan to lift people out of their current situation so they can help them selves and others (nurse, doctors, engineers).
3. **REFORM** – looking a social change, legal policy, social reform re-thinking systems & methods, lawyers, policy makers, film makers story tellers, journalists and so on.
<br>
**CONCLUSION:**
We are called out of the darkness into his marvelous light. God sends us back into the darkness to shine brightly by being planted and connected to a healthy local church community.
