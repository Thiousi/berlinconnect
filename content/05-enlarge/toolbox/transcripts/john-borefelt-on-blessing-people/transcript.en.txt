Text: **Mark 4:25 NKJV** 
We all have something that God has given us. God promises if we just use this little thing he will bless us with much more. Why not change your prayer and ask God to bless the little things you have. How can we see the potential of a diamond in other people? This is what we are all about: it’s all about people! 

1) **Dead to ourselves** 
Galatians 2:20 NIV 
If we are going to change the world we have to accept that we are actually dead to ourselves. We are not our own when we have given our life to Jesus. Our lives are so much bigger than just to live for ourselves. The price is paid and we are now His. When you don’t feel like talking to people, just go with the flow. It’s possible, because you are dead to yourself. When God gives you an opportunity to bless someone, don’t get stopped by your own comfortableness & grab it! Life is so much more than your own agenda. 

2) **We all have different shapes but the same value.**
Diamonds are all in different shapes, but very valuable at the same time. Seek first the KINGDOM (fruit of the spirit) of God. You might be the only Bible people will ever read. What kind of God’s representative are you? Whenever you see people by themselves, take the step. Many times it’s us being the answer. It’s a privilege to bring the Good News to people. Mother Theresa said: Don’t let anyone walk away from you without having made that person feel better. Proverbs 25:2 NIV It’s the glory of kings / queens to find the diamonds in people’s life. Look at people Jesus’ way and serve and care for people (whoever they are!). 

3) **See the people that are already around you.** 
Galatians 6:9 NIV 
Take care of people who already made a decision! Let’s be a church that makes real friends.
