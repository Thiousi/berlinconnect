Title: Heart For The House 2015

----

Introheading: DEAR FRIENDS

----

Introcopy: Our Heart for the House story has been nothing short of a miracle. A story of ordinary people from all walks of life making a Kingdom commitment, to be generous in resourcing the vision of Berlin Connect strengthening God’s House and extending His Kingdom.

This amazing journey of people’s hearts being drawn towards Jesus & His Church has only just begun, and is helping generate the momentum we need to reach our city and beyond for Christ.

The true miracle of Heart for the House is seeing the faithfulness of God at work in the hearts of each person and family who prayerfully decide to be involved. Remember, “Whatever leaves your hand will never leave your life”.

Joyce and I consider it an honour to lead the way and encourage you to be prayerful in your decision and level of commitment to this year’s Heart for the House miracle offering.

Building a healthy house today so we can strengthen the future generations.

We love and thank God for you.

Dear Lord, who am I, and who are these my people, that we should presume to be giving something to you? Everything
