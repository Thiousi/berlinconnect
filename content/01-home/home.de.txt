CommunityCopy: Sitting around a table of friendship and family is important to us all. As Sundays get bigger in numbers, we want our midweek connections to get more meaningful and personal. What we learn on Sundays about Christ and His kindness towards us, we get to put into practice midweek in our Dinner Parties and across every area of our lives.
