SundayCopy: Berlin Connect is a local church in the heart of our city. We believe that in our Church people from all walks of life and of all ages can feel at home. In the atmosphere of God´s love they can flourish, find friends and make a difference in society.

We want to create an atmosphere where you can form a living relationship with God and with people around you so that your life can enhance while you are experiencing your God-given potential in Christ Jesus.
