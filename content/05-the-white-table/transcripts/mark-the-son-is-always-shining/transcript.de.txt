Text: Things happen in life but you have to make the decision that only the good things stick to you.

God is calling us to build the kind of church that gets the attention of people who wouldn’t be normally found in church.

**Vision of Berlin Connect:**
- Reposition Jesus & His Church in the minds of secular Europe.
- By building a large, Christ-centered, bible-based church in the heart of Berlin.
- Changing mindsets & empowering people to lead and impact in every sphere of life.

Google "church" and you will mostly find images of buildings. Church has never been about a building.

**But church is and ALWAYS has been: about PEOPLE!!! 
only about people.**

We are sons and daughters of the most high. But also as sons & daughters our responsibility and privilege is laying the table for other lost children to come home and get close to our Father!

**The message is eternal but the methods are generational!**

Build with hospitality & generosity
Service = one size fits all!
Hospitality = I notice you!

**Heart for the House** stands for so many lives and people YET TO COME to Christ!


**Message: “WITH JESUS IT’S ALWAYS SUMMER”**
Stop  living like it’s winter and start living like it’s summer
Hebrews 12
Ephesians 1:1-4
Colossians 1:18-23

**Why do people stop?**
1. Distraction
Jesus had every reason to be distracted. But he had his eyes on the joy that was 
before him, beyond the cross. We don't know if he knew everything beyond it but he trusted his Father!
2. Discouragement
To build the church we’re trying to build we need to be brave and courageous.
3. Defeat
Living in the past, thinking of your own mistakes
“Holy, blameless and wihtout a single fault!”... that’s what God sees in you!
4. Division
Having a divided heart. 
5. Deception
So many people are pulled out of the light is because they were deceived. You need to walk in the truth DAILY, remind yourself!

**Why do people keep going?**
1. Focus
Focused on him. When we don't focus on Jesus, we might look at people and we 
might not like what we see. But with Jesus the way we look at people changes!
2. Courage
3. Victory
Live from victory, don't live from defeat! LEARN from defeat. but LIVE from VICTORY
4. Unity
Stay together both outwardly & inwardly. But that doesnt mean you should all look and act the 
same.
5. Truth
We need to walk in the truth daily

When Jesus was about to:

1. get distracted → he chose to FOCUS on his mission
2. get discouraged → he found COURAGE in his Father
3. get defeated → he was VICTORIOUS (the cross looked like a terrible defeat but it turned out to be the biggest victory throughout history!
